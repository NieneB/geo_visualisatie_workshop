## Leaflet.js

We're going to make a map of earthquakes in the Netherlands using LeafletJS as a mapping library.

- [ ] load a background map (tiles)
- [ ] plot earthquakes over top
- [ ] add another overlay layer (municipalities)
- [ ] do this in several projections: EPSG:3857 and EPSG:28992


### Create a base map
